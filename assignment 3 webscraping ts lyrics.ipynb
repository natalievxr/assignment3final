    "In this assignment I am webscraping data from folklore (2020), an album released by singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. This was an album that\n",
    "has shaped pop culture and has even won Album of the Year at the Grammys, the most prestigious award any artist can receive in their career.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple research questions:\n",
    "- Who wrote the most songs in the album?\n",
    "- Who were her main collaborators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback for first submission:\n",
    "Submission Feedback\n",
    "Overall Feedback\n",
    "- The contents of the Readme should be expanded upon. Describe your corpus in detail, e.g., what were the selection criteria? The files in the repository should be documented here, as well as the structure and contents of the CSV file. The usage rights should be explored and explained in more detail to make sure there are no assumptions being made.\n",
    "- The CSV file is very brief, containing just one row. Relating to processing, the \"Title\" column should only contain the title, e.g., 'cardigan', not '\"cardigan\" lyrics', the scraped text should be cleaned and should not be in a list. The tracklist is incomplete.\n",
    "- The notebook is fine. re library is not imported, but you use it in the code, it is not clear how it can work. It is also unclear why the tracklist is partially hardcoded towards the end of the notebook when it was already scraped a few cells above.\n",
    "- The repository is well-structured.\n",
    "- The results of the scraping task are very brief with only one row and incompletely processed columns in the CSV. A more in-depth development of this assignment could include all the songs in the tracklist that you have scraped. Consider the artist page (https://www.azlyrics.com/t/taylorswift.html). You could access the individual tracks by scraping hyperlinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take into account the feedback you've got.\n",
    "- Add a very small analysis part to your notebook, to answer a simple question about the data or show an interesting visualization (in that case, you'd have to explain what is interesting about it).\n",

1,the 1,"I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit 
Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no"" 
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though 
 
I hit the ground running each night 
I hit the Sunday matinee 
You know the greatest films of all time were never made 
 
I guess you never know, never know 
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed 
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow 
And it's alright now 
 
But we were something, don't you think so? 
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool 
And if my wishes came true 
It would've been you 
In my defense, I have none 
For never leaving well enough alone 
But it would've been fun 
If you would've been the one 
 
I have this dream you're doing cool shit 
Having adventures on your own 
You meet some woman on the Internet and take her home 
We never painted by the numbers, baby 
But we were making it count 
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now 
 
I guess you never know, never know 
And it's another day, waking up alone 
 
But we were something, don't you think so? 
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool 
And if my wishes came true 
It would've been you 
In my defense, I have none 
For never leaving well enough alone 
But it would've been fun 
If you would've been the one 
 
Hey, yeah-yeah 
I persist and resist the temptation to ask you 
If one thing had been different 
Would everything be different today? 
 
We were something, don't you think so? 
RosÃ© flowing with your chosen family 
And it would've been sweet 
If it could've been me 
In my defense, I have none 
For digging up the grave another time 
But it would've been fun 
If you would've been the one
","Swift, Dessner"
2,cardigan,"Vintage tee, brand new phone 
High heels on cobblestones 
When you are young, they assume you know nothing 
Sequin smile, black lipstick 
Sensual politics 
When you are young, they assume you know nothing 
 
But I knew you 
Dancing in your Levi's 
Drunk under a streetlight, I 
I knew you 
Hand under my sweatshirt 
Baby, kiss it better, I 
 
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed 
You put me on and said I was your favorite 
A friend to all is a friend to none 
Chase two girls, lose the one 
When you are young, they assume you know nothing 
 
But I knew you 
Playing hide-and-seek and 
Giving me your weekends 
I, I knew you 
Your heartbeat on the High Line 
Once in twenty lifetimes, I 
 
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed 
You put me on and said I was your favorite 
 
To kiss in cars and downtown bars 
Was all we needed 
You drew stars around my scars 
But now I'm bleeding 
 
'Cause I knew you 
Stepping on the last train 
Marked me like a bloodstain, I 
I knew you 
Tried to change the ending 
Peter losing Wendy 
I, I knew you 
Leaving like a father 
Running like water, I 
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing 
 
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss 
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs 
The smell of smoke would hang around this long 
'Cause I knew everything when I was young 
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time 
Chasing shadows in the grocery line 
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired 
And you'd be standing in my front porch light 
And I knew you'd come back to me 
You'd come back to me 
And you'd come back to me 
And you'd come back 
 
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed 
You put me on and said I was your favorite
","Swift, Dessner"
3,the last great american dynasty,"Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny 
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis 
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money 
And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcÃ©e do it?"" 
 
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche 
There's only so far new money goes 
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House"" 
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud 
The doctor had told him to settle down 
It must have been her fault his heart gave out 
 
And they said, ""There goes the last great American dynasty 
Who knows, if she never showed up what could've been 
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen 
She had a marvelous time ruining everything."" 
 
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever 
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city 
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names 
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet 
And losing on card game bets with DalÃ­ 
 
And they said, ""There goes the last great American dynasty 
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been 
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen 
She had a marvelous time ruining everything."" 
 
They say she was seen on occasion 
Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea 
And in a feud with her neighbor 
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green 
Fifty years is a long time 
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach 
Free of women with madness 
Their men and bad habits, and then it was bought by me 
 
Who knows, if I never showed up what could've been 
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen 
I had a marvelous time ruining everything 
I had a marvelous time 
Ruining everything 
A marvelous time 
Ruining everything 
A marvelous time 
I had a marvelous time

4,exile,"[Justin Vernon:] 
I can see you standin', honey 
With his arms around your body 
Laughin' but the joke's not funny at all 
And it took you five whole minutes 
To pack us up and leave me with it 
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall 
 
I think I've seen this film before 
And I didn't like the ending 
You're not my homeland anymore 
So what am I defendin' now? 
You were my town 
Now I'm in exile seein' you out 
I think I've seen this film before 
 
Hoo, hoo-ooh 
Hoo, hoo-ooh 
Hoo, hoo-ooh 
 
 [Taylor Swift:] 
I can see you starin', honey 
Like he's just your understudy 
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me 
Second, third, and hundredth chances 
Balancin' on breaking branches 
Those eyes add insult to injury 
 
I think I've seen this film before 
And I didn't like the ending 
I'm not your problem anymore 
So who am I offending now? 
You were my crown 
Now I'm in exile seein' you out 
I think I've seen this film before 
So I'm leavin' out the side door 
 
 [Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift:] 
So step right out 
There is no amount 
Of cryin' I can do for you 
 
All this time 
We always walked a very thin line 
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out) 
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs) 
 
All this time 
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind) 
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around) 
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs) 
So many signs 
So many signs (You didn't even see the signs) 
 
I think I've seen this film before 
And I didn't like the ending 
You're not my homeland anymore 
So what am I defending now? 
You were my town 
Now I'm in exile seein' you out 
I think I've seen this film before 
So I'm leaving out the side door 
 
So step right out 
There is no amount 
Of cryin' I can do for you 
 
All this time 
We always walked a very thin line 
You didn't even hear me out (didn't even hear me out) 
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs) 
 
All this time 
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind) 
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around) 
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs) 
You never gave a warning sign (All this time) 
(So many times) I never learned to read your mind 
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around) 
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign) 
You never gave a warning sign 
Ah, ah
","Swift, Bowery, Vernon"
5,my tears ricochet,"We gather here 
We line up weeping in a sunlit room 
And if I'm on fire 
You'll be made of ashes, too 
 
Even on my worst day 
Did I deserve, babe 
All the hell you gave me? 
'Cause I loved you 
I swear I loved you 
'Til my dying day 
 
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace 
And you're the hero flying around saving face 
And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake? 
Cursing my name 
Wishing I stayed 
Look at how my tears ricochet 
 
We gather stones 
Never knowing what they'll mean 
Some to throw 
Some to make a diamond ring 
You know I didn't want to 
Have to haunt you 
But what a ghostly scene 
You wear the same jewels 
That I gave you 
As you bury me 
 
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace 
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave 
And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake? 
Cursing my name 
Wishing I stayed 
Look at how my tears ricochet 
 
And I can go anywhere I want 
Anywhere I want 
Just not home 
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood 
But you would still miss me in your bones 
And I still talk to you 
When I'm screaming at the sky 
And when you can't sleep at night 
You hear my stolen lullabies 
 
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace 
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves 
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same 
Cursing my name 
Wishing I stayed 
You turned into your worst fears 
And you're tossing out blame 
Drunk on this pain 
Crossing out the good years 
And you're cursing my name 
Wishing I stayed 
Look at how my tears ricochet
",Swift
6,mirrorball,"I want you to know 
I'm a mirrorball 
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight 
I'll get you out on the floor 
Shimmering beautiful 
And when I break it's in a million pieces 
 
Hush 
When no one is around, my dear 
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes 
Spinning in my highest heels, love 
Shining just for you 
Hush 
I know they said the end is near 
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes 
Spinning in my highest heels, love 
Shining just for you 
 
I want you to know 
I'm a mirrorball 
I can change everything about me to fit in 
You are not like the regulars 
The masquerade revelers 
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten 
 
Hush 
When no one is around, my dear 
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes 
Spinning in my highest heels, love 
Shining just for you 
Hush 
I know they said the end is near 
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes 
Spinning in my highest heels, love 
Shining just for you 
 
And they called off the circus 
Burned the disco down 
When they sent home the horses 
And the rodeo clowns 
I'm still on that tightrope 
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me 
I'm still a believer but I don't know why 
I've never been a natural 
All I do is try, try, try 
I'm still on that trapeze 
I'm still trying everything 
To keep you looking at me 
 
Because I'm a mirrorball 
I'm a mirrorball 
I'll show you every version of yourself 
Tonight
","Swift, Antonoff"
7,seven,"Please picture me 
In the trees 
I hit my peak at seven 
Feet 
In the swing 
Over the creek 
I was too scared to jump in, but I, I was high 
In the sky 
With Pennsylvania under me 
Are there still beautiful things? 
 
Sweet tea in the summer 
Cross your heart, won't tell no other 
And though I can't recall your face 
I still got love for you 
Your braids like a pattern 
Love you to the moon and to Saturn 
Passed down like folk songs 
The love lasts so long 
 
And I've been meaning to tell you 
I think your house is haunted 
Your dad is always mad and that must be why 
And I think you should come live with 
Me and we can be pirates 
Then you won't have to cry 
Or hide in the closet 
And just like a folk song 
Our love will be passed on 
 
Please picture me 
In the weeds 
Before I learned civility 
I used to scream 
Ferociously 
Any time I wanted 
I, I 
 
Sweet tea in the summer 
Cross my heart, won't tell no other 
And though I can't recall your face 
I still got love for you 
Pack your dolls and a sweater 
We'll move to India forever 
Passed down like folk songs 
Our love lasts so long
","Swift, Dessner"
8,august,"Salt air 
And the rust on your door 
I never needed anything more 
Whispers 
Of ""Are you sure?"" 
""Never have I ever before"" 
 
But I can see us 
Lost in the memory 
August slipped away into a moment in time 
'Cause it was never mine 
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets 
August sipped away 
Like a bottle of wine 
'Cause you were never mine 
 
Your back 
Beneath the sun 
Wishing I could write my name on it 
Will you call when you're back at school? 
I remember thinking I had you 
 
But I can see us 
Lost in the memory 
August slipped away into a moment in time 
'Cause it was never mine 
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets 
August sipped away 
Like a bottle of wine 
'Cause you were never mine 
 
Back when we were still changing for the better 
Wanting was enough 
For me, it was enough 
To live for the hope of it all 
Cancel plans just in case you'd call 
And say ""Meet me behind the mall"" 
So much for summer love, and saying ""Us"" 
'Cause you weren't mine to lose 
You weren't mine to lose 
No 
 
But I can see us 
Lost in the memory 
August slipped away into a moment in time 
'Cause it was never mine 
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets 
August sipped away 
Like a bottle of wine 
'Cause you were never mine, mine 
 
'Cause you were never mine 
Never mine 
But do you remember? 
Remember when I pulled up 
And said ""Get in the car"" 
And then canceled my plans 
Just in case you'd call? 
Back when I was living for the hope of it all 
For the hope of it all 
""Meet me behind the mall"" 
 
(Remember when I pulled up) 
(And said ""Get in the car"") 
(And then canceled my plans) 
(Just in case you'd call?) 
(Back when I was living for the hope of it all) 
(For the hope of it all) 
(""Meet me behind the mall"") 
 
Remember when I pulled up 
And said ""Get in the car"" 
And then canceled my plans 
Just in case you'd call? 
Back when I was living for the hope of it all 
(For the hope of it all) 
For the hope of it all 
For the hope of it all 
For the hope of it all 
For the hope of it all
